COMPILING and INSTALLING:

If you got a official release tar archive do:
    ./configure

( otherwise if you got this from enlightenment cvs do: ./autogen.sh )

Then to compile:
    make

To install (run this as root, or the user who handles installs):
    make install

To run the unit tests (See Note 5 below):
    make check

To get the coverage report (See Notes 6 and 7 below):
    make coverage

The report is created in the coverage/ subdir




NOTE 1: You MUST make install Eet for it to run properly.

NOTE 2: For compilation with MinGW, fnmatch.h is probably missing.
        That file can be found here:

        It should be installed in the mingw include directory.

NOTE 3: For compilation with mingw32ce, run configure with the option

--host=arm-wince-mingw32ce

NOTE 4: For compilation with cegcc, follow the wiki:

NOTE 5: If you want to be able to run make check, you need library check
        from http://check.sourceforge.net/.

NOTE 6: If you want to be able to run coverage test over eet, you will need
        gcov (usually any distro provides it) and lcov from
        http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php.

NOTE 7: For coverage support you also need check support.
