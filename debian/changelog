eet (1.1.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/rules:
    - No longer delete eet_docs.tar.gz in clean, we no longer generate it.
    - Add support for building and running unit tests. They are disabled for
      now, as they are not 100% functionnal yet.
    - Stop removing doc/man/man3/todo.3, this is now shipped in the upstream
      tarball. Explicitely list the manpages we want in DEB_INSTALL_MANPAGES
      instead.
    - CFLAGS += -fvisibility=hidden so that private symbols don't get exported
  * debian/libeet1.symbols: Add a symbols file for libeet1.
  * debian/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0
    - Drop Build-Dependency on doxygen as docs are now in the upstream tarball.
    - Build-Depend on dpkg-dev (>= 1.14.8) as we are using a symbols file
